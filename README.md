# Summary

This is a basic implementation of Federated Learning(FL) using 3 clients. Federated learning (often referred to as collaborative learning) is a decentralized approach to training machine learning models. It doesn't require an exchange of data from client devices to global servers. Instead, the raw data on edge devices is used to train the model locally, increasing data privacy.

I ran the code for a total of 50 epochs
